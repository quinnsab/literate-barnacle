# literate-barnacle
A practical workspace focused on learning and applying fundamentals of the Go programming language through guided exercises.


This repository documents the progress and code samples generated while working through fundamental Go programming language concepts.

## Structure and Content

The project maintains a flat file structure optimized for rapid iteration and learning objectives. All source code (`.go` files) and project materials reside in the root directory or clearly named subdirectories that group related lessons:

*   `main.go`: Primary entry points for various experiments.
*   `lessons/`: Directory for storing specific tutorial exercises or challenges.
*   `go.mod`: The module file that defines project dependencies.

## Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Go (Golang)
*   **Environment:** GitHub Codespaces (VS Code environment)

## Usage

This project is best viewed and executed within its intended GitHub Codespaces environment, which ensures all necessary tooling is available out of the box.

To run a specific file (e.g., in a `lessons` subdirectory):

```bash
go run lessons/lesson_name.go


1.  Open the repository in a Codespace.
2.  Use the integrated terminal to run experiments (e.g., `go run cmd/your-app/main.go`).
